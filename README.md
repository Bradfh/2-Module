Notes to cover in README and Lessons Learned:

Started this repo locally and learned to use git init  (as well as utilized GitHub Desktop which is awesome)

After committing this first README line I saw that I could go back and edit the README directly on GitHub.  Also awesome.

Used <address> for first time.  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_address.asp
