# Module 2 Portfolio Project

This project was our first attempt at making a simple website from scratch using what we have learned in HTML and CSS.  The portfolio was to contain information about me, links to various projects, and contact info, as well as many HTML and CSS elements.


## Installation

N/A
    
## Usage/Examples

You can navigate to different areas of the page using the navigation buttons on the top right of the page.

You can hover over my name to see a current photo of me.

You can click on the words of the Horiseon Project to take the external github pages link.

You can click the phone to "call me" (5555555555) is not my phone number; the gmail icon to email me; or the github icon to visit my github profile.

Additionally, if you are viewing on mobile the page should scale down nicely.

## Lessons Learned

A lot of lessons were learned here.  The biggest one had to do with flexbox.  I was having hard time visualizing which containers effected which elements.  At one point I had to add red borders around every container to understand it better.  I found that flex-basis was the easiest way (for me) to get the desired result.

Almost every element on the page come with some sort of lesson attached, too many to recount.  Half of the project seemed like it was "type words into VSCode => try many things and Google many more until it worked".  The most fun thing that I did was finally get my picture to appear when I hover on my name.
